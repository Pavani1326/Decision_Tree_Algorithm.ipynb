## Project Title:
Prediction of iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm

## Problem Statement:
A American based botonical garden grow iris flower in there labs but using bio technology in a single tree diffferent type of variety flower is grow.
As a data science enginer to find out how much accuracy is there all category contains same species.

## Project Approch
# Train the classifier on the training data
decision_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

DecisionTreeClassifier
DecisionTreeClassifier()
## Project Accuracy
# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

Accuracy: 1.00

## Conclusion:

According to my decision tree model the flower not contain excit same species,but only 1% species is found
